Hello Git and Github

I'm practicing on Github to better understand all of the concepts. I'm also starting to work on team work and figuring out a good workflow for working with teams through Github. The more I learn about Github, the more I like it. I just can't get enough. And we practice some more, and some more, and some more. Today is my 56th day in a row of practicing code, not specifically Github though. Continuing to practice on Github and on Codecademy. 

Practicing some more today, going to attempt to work on some JavaScript projects from FreeCodeCamp this weekend as well as some more lessons in Codecademy.Another day, some more quality coding! Started learning about the command line and React today. Creating first React app with create-react-app CLI command. Learning to navigate the files in the React app and how to run the scripts. Starting the first project with React: Ravenous. Continuing with the Ravenous project today. Finished part 1 of the Ravenous Project.
