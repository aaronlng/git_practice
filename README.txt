Hello Git and Github

I'm practicing on Github to better understand all of the concepts. I'm also starting to work on team work and figuring out a good workflow for working with teams through Github. The more I learn about Github, the more I like it. I just can't get enough. And we practice some more, and some more, and some more. Today is my 56th day in a row of practicing code, not specifically Github though.
